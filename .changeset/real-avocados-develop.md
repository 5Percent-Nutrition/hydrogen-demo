Routing in Hydrogen has been updated according to [Custom Routes proposal](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/discussions/569). Specifically, a new `Router` component has been added, and `DefaultRoutes` has been renamed to `FileRoutes`, along with other minor changes. Custom route components are not implemented yet.
